{"name":"Raspberry Pi Wordpress Install","tagline":"A custom shell script designed for Raspberry Pi to install Wordpress along with a LAMP stack.","body":"A custom shell script designed for Raspberry Pi to install Wordpress along with a LAMP stack.  It uses Port 80 (http://localhost/ or http://<Your_IP>/) by default. This is ideal for a local blog, but it can also run as an external webpage.\r\n\r\nThis script is written for Raspberry Pi, but it theoretically could work with any Debian Linux Box with apt-get and NANO installed.\r\n\r\n<h3>Prerequisites before install:</h3>\r\nIf possible, use a clean install of the newest Raspbian Image found <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads\">here</a>.\r\nIf it is impossible or impracticle to flash your device, just ensure that you have no software installed that occupies Port 80.\r\n\r\n<h3>Installation Instructions:</h3>\r\n\r\nInstallation is easy, let's get started:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t$ git https://github.com/LikeABoss-001/Raspberry-Pi-Wordpress-Installation.git\r\n\t\t$ cd Raspberry-Pi-Wordpress-Installation\r\n\t\t$ sudo bash ./install.sh\r\n\t\t\r\nThat's it!  Press enter to any prompts that appear during the MySQL installation.\r\n\r\nWith the following command and the correct port forwarding, your blog will be visable to the outside world.  This step is not necessary.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t$ sudo bash /usr/share/doc/wordpress/examples/setup-mysql -n wordpress_mydomain_org wordpress.mydomain.org\r\n\t\t(Replace the filler domains with the domain you are attempting to set up)\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nThis project was created by Justin Harbour (LikeABoss-001) <C> 2013.
