Raspberry-Pi-Wordpress-Installation
===================================

A custom shell script designed for Raspberry Pi to install Wordpress along with a LAMP stack.  It uses Port 80 (http://localhost/) by default. 

This script is written for Raspberry Pi, but it theoretically could work with any Debian Linux Box with apt-get and NANO installed.

Installation is not available yet, but it will be soon!
